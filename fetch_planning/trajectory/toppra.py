"""Time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP-RA) — Python front-end.

Wraps the C++ ``_time_parameterization`` extension with a reusable
parameteriser object and a convenience one-shot function.  The
algorithm is Pham & Pham (2018) "A New Approach to Time-Optimal Path
Parameterization Based on Reachability Analysis", vendored from the C++

    """Time-optimal path parameteriser with fixed joint limits.

    The piecewise-linear path is resampled every ``knot_spacing`` and
    joined by a cubic spline, and TOPP-RA finds the fastest velocity
    profile along it that starts and ends at rest.  The spline passes
    through every waypoint and deviates from the straight segments by
    about ``knot_spacing / 10``, rounding the corners.

    Args:
        max_velocity: ``(ndof,)`` per-joint velocity bound.  Units must
            match the path (rad/s for revolute joints, m/s for prismatic).
        max_acceleration: ``(ndof,)`` per-joint acceleration bound.
        knot_spacing: Spline knot spacing along the path (path units).
            Smaller follows the corners more tightly, at the cost of
            slower cornering and more computation.
