"""Type stubs for the ``_time_parameterization`` C++ extension.

The actual implementation lives in ``ext/time_parameterization/`` and
ships as a compiled ``_time_parameterization.cpython-*.so`` next to this
file in the installed package.  Stubs mirror the nanobind bindings so
type checkers can resolve ``import fetch_planning._time_parameterization``.
